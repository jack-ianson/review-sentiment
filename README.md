## Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews Dataset (Subset from HuggingFace)

![Python CI](https://github.com/jack-ianson/forecast-cnn-lstm/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Various sentiment analysis models. Currently developing a deep bag of words model. Next is to train RNN-based model with LSTM, 1D CNN, self-attention based approaches (without pre-training) and then pre-trained models. Setting up testing and CI as I go.

Got no results yet, but the first model is training okay... A work in progress
