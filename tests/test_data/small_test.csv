2,Great CD,"My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing ""Who was that singing ?"""
1,oxo good grips jar poor product,I previous had a similar jar opener and have 2 places and wanted to keep one in one place and the other in another. This jar opener is an inferior product and the worse thing I ever purchased from Amazon(and I purchased numerous things)It doesn't grips all jars and it should have advised me of what it was made of.It looked various similar to the other one I own and I can't wait till I can find another jar opener like the other one so I can throw this one in the garbage.
2,a college essential,"Requires a rather spacey flat surfact to work on, so you might have to carry a hardcover book with you if the room doesn't have a foldout table. Other than that, this product, along with my clie 760 has really made note taking a breeze in college, and having all the files saved on my computer makes indexing that much easier. Overall, I would highly recommend this product, along with a small PDA over any laptop."
2,This a great gift for younger girls!!!,I this was a great x-mas for my 3 and 6 daughters for their first mp3 player. THEY LOVE IT!!! And the price was so low that i ended up getting two more for my daughter's best friends as presents.
2,Is blogging worth it?,"Since I've been blogging for several years now, I frequently get asked if it's worth it. My answer is a resounding yes. With the help of corporate blogging expert Debbie Weil, I've learned how to leverage my expertise to establish a thought leadership position in the market. [...]But that's not the only reason to be blogging. In her new book, Debbie covers 13 ways you/your company can use a blog, plus a ton of tips for writing an effective blog. She even spends a whole chapter on determining your ROB (return on blog).If you're trying to decide if blogging is right for your company, this book addresses many of the questions you may have such as: How much time it takes? What are the legal considerations? Who should do it in your company?Finally, it concludes with an information-rich, 40+ page bonus resource section that's excellent."
1,worst amazon description ever,"first off all i got this as a gift from my uncle, i returned it because the product description was WRONG.The product title says its ""single"" and in the product description it says "" it comes with two of each items such as bulbs, foglights, harness and everything else that's needed. i called customer service i complained and asked them nicely to fix the product description this was 5 months ago today is 7/7/2011. and here it is, the description is still the same. im very disappointed...."
1,disappointed,"The quality of this item was very poor. The power plug did not fit snug & therefore fell out easily; there were 3 bright pixels that distracted from the viewing; the AV in did not function properly. This discourages me from buying other Coby products. However, Amazon did refund my full purchase, as well as that of the case I had bought with it."
2,Makes you miss the late 70's,This is great movie. Too bad Hollyweird doesn't make them like this anymore. This movie makes you miss the late 70's.
2,Excellent book for the enthusiast or novice,Though some documents are understandably edited for length (the entire book is almost 1000 pages) this book is surprisingly comprehensive. I have not seen another text that includes as many important primary documents from such a span of our History in one single volume--and for as low a price as it is. It is an excellent buy.
2,Masterful writing,"Pete Hamill is a master story teller and he is very skilled at drawing the reader into time and place. Forever is no exception. This novel has a bit of everything - philosophy, science fiction, love, sex, blood and history. On this level, Forever is masterful. Hamill kept my interest up, even when the plot became predictable. His fluid writing and evocative settings make for great reading.The down side of Forever is that, although I believe we are intended to empathize with the story's protagonist, I found him rather unsympathetic. His dwelling on the past, his unrestricted sexual appetites, his unwillingness to commit to anyone or anything left me rather cold. I understand that this was necessary for the plot, but it did leave me feeling detached. I found this a real shame, since the basic book is really wonderful."
2,Continuing the story,I love the worlds and the plots. She continues to intrigue me with new questions and great books!
2,Riverboat,"We purchased Riverboat The Complete series, to date we are part way through the set. I remember this series back when it first came on TV, we enjoyed it then and we continue to enjoy the series now, so far both the storyline and the acting are very good, we are big fans of Darren McGavin in many of the shows he has been involved with over the years. The quality of the sound and picture are as we have come to expect from Timeless Media Group, we are very pleased with our purchase. Thank you to both Amazon and Timeless Media Group."
2,Book,"Written by my favorite child behavior advisor, Jim Fey. This was a gift and I did read this one before giving it. I thought it was excellenst and coined the parents/guardians right on. Highly recommend this book for parents and teachers."
1,Really Disappointed.,"I have been using timex watches for most my life. Then one day when I was trying to be on time, I noticed this watch was losing time, 10 minutes slow, then later 15 minutes slow. I thought that maybe the battery is dying, so I went and got a new battery. the next day, watch is still 10 or 15 minutes slow. Timex has lost my business, If you care about quality and value time please avoid buying these watches."
1,long velour lounger,"The material this robe was made from did not meet my expectations. The robe looked great, but it was not soft nor well made."
1,sex change,Wot has happened to the band that i loved at album one has jonathon davis had a sexchange because he souns like a girl and the whole album this continues pure assult to the ears.
1,OVER-RATED,"There are a few things this game does right, but one of the most important things it does wrong. The world that you are supposed to be immersed in is a failure. It's very robotic and way too simple. I guess the best way to put it is that it just feels fake. An example of a well done world is the game Fable. Now these 2 games are very different but my point is, when playing Fable, you kind of believe that this place could exist, if only in fantasy. But with Splinter Cell, this world could never exist, fantasy or no fantasy, because the overall execution is just plain crappy. I would look elsewhere if you're looking for a really good game."
1,"Mostly Boring, Poorly Filmed","Ok, yes Hathaway did a good job with the character. However, the movie was incredibly boring at times. 20 mins is spent on speeches at the rehearsal dinner. Zzzzzz. Who cares? 15 mins were spent on a dishwasher loading discussion. Wow. We got to watch each person at the reception dance, over and over. The music was annoying. The camera bounces constantly and zings back and forth from character to character making the movie feel like an amateur filmed it.There are only moments in this movie that are ok. Certainly not enough to make me buy it or see it again."
2,Amazing,"The book can be summed up in one word: amazing. The reader, looking at the cover so simple, is not able to fathom the depth of its content. What caught my attention was the wealth of detail in reports of armed conflict, especially trials rarely explored by other authors as the Congress of Vienna and the Court of Leipzig. Fundamental to any study of war crimes tribunals."
2,South American Geography,This is an excellent book for young children who are just beginning to learn about the world.
2,tug boat of come alongs,The easy to put together was good and minor; the working of the Tuf Tug is great we used it from a bumpper of a truck ball wrapped around a fence pole with a strap to bend back a pole that was dented by vistior truck. I can say with normal wenching pulled the bent pole back into place all is good and the Tuf-Tug easy to release.Also great for the price and operations.
1,Ick,"Well, the winning streak with the SEALS is definitely over. No one in this book I would care to get to know better."
2,Grandma's House,"The post-Thanksgiving drive home from Grandma's house dragged into hours... Unsurprisingly, our little music enthusiast asked to hear the CD again - the surprise was that we loved it! Having this album on your ipod or in your car is a MUST."
2,Great quality,"I'm a Canon guy, but I have to give it to Nikon on their quality optics. This is probably the best wide-angle CP on the market. It has many layers of multicoating, the edges are knurled so you can grip it to get it on/off and adjust, and you can even still attach a lens cap.I was hesitant to buy this one for my wide-angle lens due to the fact that you could still attach a lens cap. I thought it would vignette, but I read the specs on all of the other available wide-angle CP's and none of them are slimmer than 5mm (which is the thickness of this CP). So, I went ahead a took a leap of faith. I'm glad I did!This is an excellent quality product. Get ONE that will fit your largest diameter lens, and get B+W step-up rings for your other lenses so you can use a CP on all of your lenses without buying a CP for each."
2,Manfrotto 785B tripod - Good tripod for travelling,"This little tripod is great for traveling. I mounted my D200 + 17-55mm lens on it was quite stable. The only bad thing is the non-removable head. Then again what do you expect for a $80 dollar product. It beats carrying a 6lbs (with head) tripod when you go on a trip...To increase the stability, just hang some weights on the tripod and that should do the job."
1,To much Rock,"Bob Rock that is. I think at this point in time, they need to kick Bob to the curb and find a producer that isn't so invloved and close with the band. THe new Bass player DOESN'T EVEN PLAY on the CD, Bob Rock did all Bass playing on this album, plus he produced, recorded, and mixed it. Because of this, the album is almost impossible to listen to. You ALWAYS need smoebody's perspective ad opion that isn't with the band, and at this point, Bob isn't it. I'm glad I can't hear the bass guitar most of the time, the playing is horrible. The drums are even worse. I've tried to listen to this CD on many occasions, and I can't get past the snare drum. It is the loudest instrument on the whole CD and starts to give me a headache after a while. The music/song writing is actually pretty good, but it is almost impossible to listen to. I've always thought that Metallica should hire Producer extraordinaire Andy Wallace. He is needed now more than ever."
2,Not bad..,"Vampire movies = GoodHistorically accurate Vampire movies = Betterok so im sure its not totally historical but it does give a little background and history about Vlad Tepes (Dracula) which I find to be very interesting. All in all the storyline was interesting, acting was good and it was filmed quite well. The only con I can think of was Billy Zane.. seriously, I think as an actor you really need to learn your role including the language that they would speak (at least a little) lol.. Billy Zane is a good actor though and played the part quite well. Very good film I would say!"
2,Fascinating,"This book was an eye-opener for me. It discusses the strengths and weaknesses of networks and the Internet; what to look out for; how to protect yourself; what makes the systems tick. I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that it was hard to put the book down. Aside from the author's own writings, there are hundreds of additional references which can be used to research hacking and defending networks on the Internet. This book is invaluable for system administrators."
2,Won't work right unless you use Duracell batteries,"I own two of these units that were purchased about two years apart. The second unit never worked quite right. The door would often not open on the first unlock. I thought the locking mechanism needed to be oiled or something.However a close inspection of the instruction manual says not to use any other batteries except eight (8) AA Duracell's. Once I switched from Energizers to Duracell's my second unit is now working flawlessly.If anyone is having trouble with their unit, the first thing you should check is the batteries!"
2,Looking for something efective,"Bought the product because last year my dog, a wonderful big Golden Retriever had a serious desease from ticks, and the products we had been using did not provide good enough coverage for ticks. Have applied it today because I just came back from the States and will see if it works.....our vet said it's very good, so we hope the dog will be effectively protected and able to go to his everyday walk, everywhere."
1,Piece of Junk,"Same as ""An Electronics Fan"". Occasionally prints a document. On those occasions where it does not, it won't let you delete the failed document from the print queue. It says it's deleted, but when further attempts are made to print other documents, the print jobs just fill up in the queue, waiting for the first job to complete. The only way to clear the printer queue is to reboot. But there's another problem. The document that was holding up the queue gets printed during the reboot process. That's wasted paper, since by that time you no longer need the printout after having spent more than a few minutes deciding that you don't really need it (eg., maps from mapquest).I've forgotten about failed print jobs only to find that when I rebooted my machine days later, the printout came out. This is a piece of junk. Perhaps there will be a software upgrade, if that is indeed the problem."
1,Biggest piece of garbage EVER,"I have owned this product for over a year and it is truly, bar none, the biggest piece of garbage ever. Customer service is non-existent. When I was using DSL for my internet connection, I had to reset my connection at least 3 times a day. Now that I changed to cable internet, I still have to reset the connection at least twice a week. I would give this product negative 10 stars if I could. Truly an awful product."
1,"Good idea, bad execution",I'm mostly disappointed with Gaiam's customer service. The ball that came with my chair was NOT the same ball in all of the photos. It was more like a glorified beach ball and the chair was nowhere near high enough to reach any of the desks in my office. I took the tiny ball out and inserted my friend's Gaiam ball which is bigger and it works very well and I really love it! I wrote Gaiam days ago asking if they would exchange the ball for me but they have yet to respond so now I have to go SPEND MORE MONEY and get the proper ball. Such a disappointment and more trouble than I should have to go through.
2,this helmet probably saved my life,"I had a pretty serious cycling accident where I ended up with my head on the concrete at 20 mph (my head literally bounced). This helmet soaked it up and I'm still alive. A good deal, indeed."
1,Item was defective,"The item arrived in packaging looking like it had been opened prior and had been returned. Plugged it in and got a constant hum and the reset button didn't work. No power to the unit at all. The seller accepted the item as a return, no problem. I didn't have to pay for the return shipping and my entire order, including original shipping charge, was refunded, so I was pleased with that, at least. I've learned that buying electronics over the internet can sometimes be tricky, but with Amazon I have NEVER had a problem with any return."
2,I was pleasantly surprised,"A friend of mine really wanted to see this so, reluctantly, I went with... To my great surprise I really liked it - A Lot!!! I just got on the list to be alerted when it becomes available on Blu-Ray. The choreography and eye-candy is really outstanding. The music is really good too. Prior to this I was not a big fan of Christina Aguilera but now realize that she is truly a great singer. I also think that Cher is a great singer and actress, but personally don't like the sound of her voice so that would be my only disappointment with this movie. Still Cher does a great job and I enjoyed her perfomance nevertheless."
2,Excellent Workouts and delivery,"These workouts are fun and very effective. I am having a little trouble with the dvd, however, just haven't gotten around to informing Amazon. They are very responsive when approached on problems, however. Overall a good workout."
1,Grat price but not an investment,"I bought this form Target. It worked as advertised. However, after chopping up some garlic, some of the small garlic bits got into the handle through multiple holes in the design where the cover and the work bowl locks into place with the motor.There is no way to clean off the bits stuck in the handle once it gets in there.I'm planning on returning this unit."
1,OOOH NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!,"Some BRAIN DEAD editor destroyed this show by cutting some of the most entertaining performances. The broadcast was great, but this chopped up DVD is very disappointing."
1,Very Bad,"I cannot stress this enough, this book is very boring and longwinded. Only if you are doing research on this time period do you need to even consider this book. It book talks very little about the Declaration and more about famous people that you already know about."
1,"Used to be decent, now it's pretty much junk","This used to be a pretty decent music magazine. Not the best that was out there, but still decent. However, Rolling Stone has taken a huge nose-dive in the past ten or so years. I'm not sure I'd even really call it a music magazine anymore. It's more a pop-culture magazine that panders to teeny-boppers. A music magazine's main focus should be music, but RS has over the years started including more and more articles on TV shows, movies, politics, etc and less and less on music...especially less and less on good music. If you want a magazine on pop-culture go with Entertainment Weekly. It, at least, has a bit of taste here and there and doesn't spout off about politics. If I want politics, I'll read the newspaper or watch CNN. I don't buy music magazines for politics. I buy them for music. If you want a good music magazine, this isn't the place to look anymore."
2,"Misconception of Reviewer ""An Electronics Fan""","The only review of this recorder (Sony TCM-500DV) says that the recorder and appropriate adaptor ""have been discontinued."" According to Sony, neither is the case. The recorder is still available as is the appropriate Sony Worldwide AC Power Adaptor, their model number AC-E30A."
2,AMONG THE TOP ADVENTURE STORIES FOR BOYS AND SCOUTS,"Gary Paulson is an excellent storyteller with a keen sense of adventure. the story opens with a young boy en route via a small plane to see his father in the wilderness when the plane crashes and the pilot dies. All the boy has is a tiny hatchet that was given to him before he left on his trip. He sets out on a path of survival as he awaits rescuing. This book contains mature themes (death, consequences, mistakes) that portray the realistic images that Gary paulson portrays. Having three Scouts in the house, this was an adventure book they all approved of enought that they have encouraged us to purchase more Gary Paulson books."
2,cute little doll,This doll is cute my daughter likes to take her binky off its just hilarious to steal a binky.Its fits pretty good in her fisher price stroller and is a nice well made stuffed baby doll.
1,Total waste of time!,"This book is really bad. I can't figure it out. We all know John Grisham can write, so how come he decided to waste both his own and our time with this absolutely worthless pice of junk? Very odd. It is bad from beginning to end. Especially the end. There is no reason to read this book."
1,Oh Please! Help Me......,"Okay, first off, this albums cover is a little bit inticing you to buy such a rotten album. I don't know who gave madonna the idea of realsing such a ridiculous album. But it sure was a poor job of just putting a a few remixes here and a a few there and rather not putting som much work and getting a little more tracks into the album. I like Madonna but here, I think she's htting us all up for credits! Take my Advice it is not worth it. And I've heard better from her!"
2,"Kindle edition includes 2009 ""Afterword"" chapter","I will echo others in saying this is a compelling book, made more so by the spare, journalistic quality of Junger's writing. I was pleasantly surprised to see that for the Kindle edition, Junger has added an Afterword that puts the 1991 storm in greater context, discusses the filming of the movie in Gloucester and other sea tragedies right up to 2009. ... If you liked this, try Junger's ""WAR."""
2,This is the best mixer ever,"Seriously, this is the best handmixer I have ever owned. The food processor part does and EXCELLENT job and even chops celery. I have had it for at least 3 years now and still going strong!!!"
2,My daughter loves it!,We have two cats in the house and she just loves to look at this book and play with all the touch and feel objects. It's her favorite book!
1,Stiff and not true to size,This is a very stiff shoe. I ordered the size to match a size 7 US. It was cut very small.
2,Good but misses a lot of topics,"The book explains the basics of Windows Server 2003 in detail. It however leaves lot of important topics. By the time it starts talking about active directory and group policy the book almost ends. It has no info about using RIS (remote installation services), WSUS (to do windows update centrally), IIS 6.0, central Software installations from Group policy etc to name a few. I think the Author expects us to buy another book in case one is interested in these topics. Even after being such a big book it was of not much use to me."
1,Nice look but cheaply made,"Within a week of install the LEDs stopped functioning properly....could be a case of needing fresh batteries but even so that's ridiculous given that it's right out of the package and I haven't turned on the lights much. Plus the mesh has a drawback, if you have anything on your hand it scrapes it off and it's a pain to clean the little holes. All in all it's pretty, but ultimately not worth the money in my opinion."
1,Great for Beginners - Awful for everyone else...,"If you need to learn how to Minimize windows, use a mouse, and learn various basic Windows skills, this is the book for you. If you want to learn about Win2K, skip this one. Written in simplistic terms for people who know little, if anything, about any Windows OS, this book teaches little.I bought this book hoping to immerse myself in the new WIN 2K. I feel cheated by this book: few points about WIN2K. Instead, this book focuses on basic (and I mean basic) Windows skills. I think this book should have been retitled ""WIN 2K for Dummies by Microsoft.""Skip this one and look for another alternative. This book will not teach you anything you don't already know."
2,"Yes, I would like some more.,,...,...,.","This is my favorite Roots album, despite the fact that seemingly everyone in the universe worships Things Fall Apart, which is also a very good album. But on Do You Want More, The Roots create a chill out jazzy vibe that I have never been able to find again on any other hip-hop album. This album is a great listen, either on your headphones or as background music in your living room. I just wish The Roots would drop the guitars and go back to the jazzy beats full time. Of course, they probably wouldn't have as many MTV videos if they did that, so hey, do your thing."
1,NOT for parents,"I read a different book every month on some issue related to parenting, and this was one of the least helpful or relevant. Much of it was pedantic, some of it was common sense, and a lot of it was just plain not rooted in, or applicable to, reality but was instead too laboratory based. I would not be at all surprised if the author has no children of his own. However, I do appreciate the overall concept of what he is discussing and the book does provide some food for thought."
2,Good heavy guitar picks,"These picks are great if you want heavy and stiff picks. I am not a good guitar player by any stretch, but these help me get a good feel for the strings. Highly recommend."
2,Nice wallet,I love this wallet..very nice quality and pretty color. I bought it to go with a purse I bought here at Amazon and I love it.
2,Bilal's art brought to the big screen,"I grew up on the ""comic book"" (now ""graphic novellas""?) magazines Heavy Metal/Metal Hurlant, so I know Bilal's work quite well. He is definitely one of the best artists in the genre, though his story lines are somewhat convoluted and extremely multi-layered. It takes a bit of concentration to get the whole story, but the artwork is so fantastic, it's worth the effort. EXACTLY like this movie - which is essentially a Bilal story come-to-life (and CGI). It is quite a feat, especially, as others noted, with a fraction of the funds available for similar Hollywood fare. This is very well done, probably the best comic book-to-screen transfer I have yet seen in terms of remaining true to its source."
2,An excellent read!,"I have interests in cooking and history. This book covers both and in an excellent way. The author's writing style is engaging and entertaining. I felt drawn into the book immediately and have a hard time putting it down. Ms. Coe's insights are funny and the amount of detail presented feels just right. She covers first the foodstuffs unique to the Americas then dives into the specifics for the Aztecs, the Maya, and the Inca. She discusses both pre-European contact and post-European contact cuisines and cultures.It isn't really a recipe book but her descriptions of the food gave me many ideas on how to prepare some of the dishes listed. It is truly a culinary anthropology book but don't let that put you off; it is easy and worthwhile even for us lay-folk. I also have a copy of her book on chocolate and am looking forward to reading that when this one is done.I recommend it if you have any interest in cooking, history, the Americas, or any of the cultures listed."
1,Not my cup of tea,"I have to agree with the reviewer Karen and also with Mr. Volgel. Gloryland is not my cup of tea.Rather than add to the discussion of what shape note music is, who sings it for whom, and other exercises, this CD reminds me of the Turtle Island Quartet's offering of Coltrane's ""A Love Supreme."" The music is well done, but it's just not Trane or what the composers meant for it to be. I'm trying to think of a genre where this CD would fit and can't.The only track that appealed to me was ""Wayfaring Stranger,"" and I think that is because it reminds me of some very early Joan Baez, but this track is dissimilar to the others. Perhaps my problem with the Anonymous 4's approach is I've heard several of these songs and it's as if they are trying to put a square peg in a round hole.That said, the disc obviously appeals to some, but not to me. What to do? Download a track or two for a buck each and see what you think before paying full price."
2,Love,This little steamer is perfect for steaming my clothes when I need it. It works great! You can't expect it to do a heavy duty industrial steam job because it's made for quick fixes.
2,Nice product,It was very easy to set up. Seem sturdy. Lots of room inside. Would recommend this product . Greta for our deck!
2,As good as could be hoped for:,It is wonderful to hear the soundtrak...the movie is wonderful but the music is just as wonderful to enjoy itself.
1,It was not what I asked for,I wanted genuine leather and this was not that it is just paper bound that looks like leather. The description was not true.
2,Hilarious!,"It's cheesy...it's dumb...it's your typical 80's college guy flick. In other words, it's great. Who doesn't want to get laid? Who hasn't had those times where they can't seem to do anything right when it comes to the opposite sex? This is a VERY tongue in cheek look at our boy Pondo 'Hound Dog' Sinatra, a college student who just wants a piece. Gotta love it!!"
1,simple minded,"if you've heard his radio show, you know how annoying and predictable and boring rusty is. how he got syndicated, i'll never know. the c.d. is only slightly better than his talk show.david"
2,Perfect!,"I purchased this radiator for my 2000 VW GTI VR6 and it fit like a glove! The product was shipped to me EXTREMELY fast. Great price for a replacement radiator, especially when the dealer is selling it for $250! Highly recommended."
2,Surprisingly powerful,"I don't have a lot of experience with graphic novels, but this one is really powerful. It almost moved me to tears in several places. I love the illustrations in which she imagines what's going on in her daughter's brain. A great book to share with teen moms or any young mom who needs some encouragement about pursuing a college degree. Accessible even for those who aren't big readers."
1,Poor quality - buy items separately.,The nasal aspirator is garbage - doesn't work and caused my son's nose to bleed. Same goes for the nail clippers - they cut him as they don't position well for small fingers. The medicine measurer is useless as medication you buy already comes with this. You can use any comb/brush for a baby. The rattle was mildy entertaining. Waste of money.
2,One of Jacqueline Baird's Best,"Jacqueline Baird is without a doubt one of HP best writers. I borrowed several of her older books from a friend and just finished, The Reluctant Fiancee which I thoroughly enjoyed. Now I'm going to try and obtain a copy for myself. It was so funny and sexy and I absolutely loved the hero and heroine. Despite the age difference (15 years) the sparks lit up the pages. Awesome job Ms. Baird!"
2,Serial Port Gold,"For Visual Basic programmers working with serial ports, if you are not an expert at them, then you need this book. Since I already had a great deal of experience with serial ports, most of this was not new to me. However, instead of having to train some colleagues on all the details, I recommended they buy this book. They did and it made them very proficient with serial ports. They kept the books."
2,"Great wrap, but gets really hot","The Moby wrap is amazing. I love that it is so versatile with it's many different positions (forward facing, hip carry, newborn hug, etc). It also helps distribute the weight evenly, so my back and shoulders don't scream in pain. However, I gave this wrap a 4 star because it does take practice to figure out how to do the actual wrappings. I had to watch a lot of YouTube videos, so definitely not an intuitive wrap. Also, the wrap gets really hot. After 10 minutes or so, both baby and I are soaking in sweat. Fabric doesn't seem to breathe very well, which is a bummer."
1,waste of money and time,"this movie was pathetic. The acting was horrible,watching scarlett j play the role of poor college student was truly agonizing and crummy bad acting. woody allen uses the same ""With all due respect"" lines in every scene...and the ghost of a dead guy? get real, ive watched sesame street come up with better plots than this. hugh jackman is deeeelicious and thats the only reason why ANYONE should bother renting this movie..just mute it :)"
2,Short of the Chat Pen,"Logitech IO is based on the Anoto system ...The problem with this pen is that it does not contain the bluetooth wireless connectivity that the SonyEricsson Chatpen does which would make it universally usable anywhere. Who wants to drag the Cradle around?Letter recognition can be done through Windows'/Office's own Document Imaging, so that solves that problem. The paper will not be much more expensive than most other paper. Afterall it is regular paper with a fine dot system printed on it. You will even be able to print it yourself with a regular ink-jet printer, should the need arise...The pen is a step in the 'write' direction as another reviewer mentioned, yet we are still waiting for the heavy-weights to bring their pens out. For the pen to be more usable, it NEEDS to be wireless, without silly download-cradles.Good for the the person that just uses it around the house..."
1,exceptionally poorly constructed reference book,"A real need for further editions on this book. As others have commented, it's very poorly constructed, poorly indexed and you'll be hard-pressed to quickly find accurate definitions. As other posters have suggested, O'Reilly should be worried that this one got published in this state."
2,Amen by myself,This story line shows that every family have some drama and it is never too late to reach out to each other and heal
1,Very poor workout DVD,"This workout consists of doing a lot of quick, jerky moves, without real instructions about how to safely do them. You get hardly any instruction on how to properly place your body. Billy spends more time telling you to smile than how to properly perform his workout. Also, his sidekick/cheerleader doesn't demonstrate great control when she does the moves either. Also, this DVD is not divided into chapters so you can do just upper body, lower body, or ab work, or even skip past the intro. It is basically just a video put onto a DVD, and the sound quality is pretty poor. I do NOT recommend that anyone buy this workout DVD."
2,I like this one,"I'm always worried about bad ambient music or someone being a third or fourth rate Brian Eno, Also I hate these albums that come out and there is this god aweful ticking sounds which is annoying, my other complaints are flutes harmonizing in the background and dripping water and birds. and yes wind, bells and harmmonizing Awwwwwwwwwwwwweee angels.with immersion One you don't get that thankfully. You get a long album and after you start playing it you forget its on and you can work your stuff. Now if you like that sort of thing this is your album and perhaps the immersion 2-3 as well."
1,Not nearly as warm as advertised,"This hat was a great disappointment, it is nowhere near as warm as other comments made it seem."
2,Not too shabby,"I bought this for my Sony Cybershot DSCP73, it can hold about 150 pictures at 4 megapixels. Also, I like the fact that it's all stored on one side, it's not one of those 128MB + 128MB that you have to flip."
2,Great Watch You can buy,it is really good has a good look and also a very good price great watch It has a good feel and a confy watch Fast shipping
2,Indredible CD for old & new fans but old fans may feel....,"Hats off to Scott's song writing, Jeff's vocal percussion, and Kevin's sweet voice!This CD is a must have for both old and new fans but old fans may feel something is missing. Acutually, I did. This album makes me feel like ""Scott with Rockapella"". I could not find Elliott and Barry so often on this CD. It is kind of sad thing.Still, Rockapella is the King of musicians. Go get this CD now!"
1,WORST BOOK ON EARTH...SOMEBODY KILL ME,"i have to read this book for a school assignment and i want to kill myself. it is sooooo slow and boring, i want to strangle Pauline Gedge. Im 100% sure that this book couldnt get any worse...unless i actually had to read it."
2,This album deserves more than 5 stars!,"I wouldn't describe this as nu-metal or heavymetal, but just plain hard rock. Although this is Korns only raw, power, & heavy album to date before they've went soft on the album ""See You On The Other Side"" of course without Head being in the group no more but now I've heard they've got a new guitarists & hopefully they'll a have a huge impact return with raw heavy again but even though its likely that classic Korn won't be coming back ever again after they've suffered on ""Follow The Leader"", but I did indeed like their future as well so on theirs no complaints from me, & yes I did even like ""See You On The Other Side"" too! No matter what happens, Korn will always be a profile of metal history in my book."
2,set your world on fire,"this is great cd to give you the overall feel on jane's solo career. I really love some of the older cuts such as ""blue kiss"" which is sorta a classic to some people who love light headed fun pop. Of course you have rush hour which is so catchy and bouncy...i still remember the video with jane swimming among the dolphins. the dance clubesque song of the factory is a miss that should have hit big...hopefully this song will eventually be discovered for the great dance beat and ethereal feel to it. Anyway give this cd a spin...jane sounds like a little pixie...you just want to wave your wand over her and make her sing in her wispy way!"
1,Very muted colors,"I already have a decent inkjet, but I wanted one with higher resolution and better photo-realism. I read reviews about the C80. The resolution on it is fantastic. But, after running 4 hours of trials on it (in a serious attempt to achieve decent color), I decided to return it. On my other printer (only 1440 dpi) the colors are crisp, rich, and sharp -- especially the blacks. Looking at conventionally developed photographs, the same can be said. On the C80, the colors are VERY muted -- DULL. I called Epson, and they confirmed that the archival inks have a different tone than their standard inks. The Espson driver doesn't even offer an independent control over the black saturation (even though it does provide one for cyan, magenta, and yellow). If you're looking for realistic photos, this is NOT the way to go if color is important."
1,SKIP THIS ONE,"I was really disappointed with this book. Most of it is written in a "" it is known to have been"" style which sounds like guessing. The info is basically a list of styles. The photos are terrible."
2,Amost AMAZING,I love the book pretties I just wished it had a different ending.I stayed up one whole night just to read this book I couldn't stop myself from finshing it.I can 't wait to read the next one.
2,this is the best cd and who ever dosnt like it [stinks],this is the best cd and if u dont like it then u [stink] chester is an awsome singer and mike is a good rapper there music is the best i heard EVER!!!!! no one even comes close to them and if u dont like them u must like country like my dad.or oldies .this the best cd ever i cant wait for the new one to come out in the end is a awsome song and runaway is preaty good
1,Be aware of the shipping charge!,"The seller charged almost $320.00 for shipping and handling. Think of this: The item is in a box and requires assembly. So why is the shipping and handling so expensive? Almost twice the price of the item. In addition, the claim that the item is manufactured by the seller does it imply it is a refurbished one as another reviewer stated?"
2,A must read for parents,"When my son was diagnosed I felt helpless and empty but as a guy I NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING TO FIX IT. I went to my small town library not expecting to find very much info on autism. This book was there. I read it...the whole thing...in one day. It helped me process my feelings and gave me hope. Now when my son has an issue related to his autism, I'm not taken aback; rather, I recall what the author stated and reconfigure my thinking to match his and we work on the issue together. Without this book as my first read I believe I would missed some beautiful opportunities to communicate with my son. Our bond is strengthen because of what I learned in this book. This book made the first steps into the world of autism doable. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!!!!"
1,Terrible,"I was so disappointed in this camera that i returned it. i thought it was terrible - the picture quality is horrendous. it looked better on the actual camera than it did on my computer. the pictures are grainy; they're neither sharp nor clear. I was just vey disappointed with this camera. I wanted to update from my canon digital elph b/c i've had mechanical problems with it. the elph, though older, took much sharper, crisper pictures than this. it was just incredibly disappointing, especially when nikon is known for their cameras."
1,Interesting but buggy,"And I mean ""buggy"" as in this piece of software will suddenly crash and leave you with an UNOPENABLE file, not useable at all -- goodbye to who knows how many hours of work?It's interesting software and it's great with a Wacom tablet, but Corel just doesn't seem to be able to get their stuff together and I'm certainly not in a hurry to spend MORE money on a new version hoping they got it right.I mean, expecting to be able to save and re-open a file is not asking for the moon."
1,Not the Best Tub,"This tub was great for my son when he was a newborn but once he outgrew the sling it was horrible! He was too big for the sling but not able to sit on his own yet. Because of the design of this tub and it's lack of padding or support, he kept slipping and sliding around making it impossible to wash him because it took 2 hands just to hold him up. Now I have to buy another tub. I wish I had never bought this one. There are much better tubs out there - Don't waste your money."
1,-_-_-_-_-_-_-,"I bought the Braun MR430HC mainly to help blend foods for my young son. It worked well for about five months. Then the motor died. Braun boasts a one-year warranty, but if you don't live near a service center and have to use the mail, it will probably cost you less to buy a new unit. If I were you, take a pass on this hand blender and buy one more reliable, even if it means spending a little more money."
1,Copland would turn over in his grave!,This is one of the worst sounding CD's I ever bought!!! Sounds flat like listening thru a pillow and the violins are schrechy and hard sounding.Its just awful.If you want listeners fatigue this is the cd for you!
1,Dummies shouldn't run Linux.,"Linux, Like UNIX from which it is descended, is not an operating system for dummies. If you are a dummy, get (but don't buy) windoze. I am amazed at the arrogance of the author. Linux is a beautifully complex system, which no 'dummy' could ever hope to comprehend. If you are indeed a dummy, linux is just not for you; you will have little success. As a great man once said: ""UNIX _is_ user friendly, it is just particular about which users it is friendly to"""
2,Very good!!,I bought this shaver as a birthday present for my daughter. She is very happy ans satisfied with it.
1,Utterly Pointless,"First, let me say that I regard J.M. Coetzee as one of the best craftsmen of literary fiction alive today. One would never know it, however, if this novel were the only work of Coetzee's that one had ever read. Though the prose is well-written in the usual Coetzee style, there is no real story here, only a somewhat bizarre, meandering (and dull, to be frank) interaction of characters whose purposes and motives are never fully revealed or explained. I was ultimately left with a bewildering sense of not knowing exactly what it was that I had just read after all was said and done. If judged on story alone, I would only give it 1 star but Coetzee's style begrudgingly earns it another.For Coetzee fans I'd recommend that you skip this one. For those unfortunate enough to have had this novel be your sole Coetzee experience, I suggest that you read the Booker Prize-winning Disgrace and allow Coetzee to redeem himself."
1,Please Make it stop!,"I have only browsed this book while at Barnes & Noble. But I will not buy it or any other Jordan book until the series is finished. My advice, find an author who finished a good series, like Raymond Feist, Roger Zelazny, or just reread some other greats. Lots of web discussions will fill you in on good SciFi/Fantasy. As for this drivel, you WILL waste precious hours and days of your life if you pick this up. Stay away at all costs! And watch out for George R R Martin too! I feel a Jordan in the making, although I must admit his world is far more compelling and exciting."
2,the wonderful world of redwall,"This book is um... how do u say a tid bit off beat. It is about a warrior mouse, yeah didnt appeal to me either. It is set in a mid-evil type setting, only with animals,yes animals as the ""people""(like i said off beat). The author Brian Jacques is a outstanding writer. His style keeps you wanting more of the book. The language used is a bit hard to understand at first, but you get used to it. He uses foreshadowing to keep your attention. Its a really good book with a awesome story line. So go ahead and read it."
1,Go for a Roady XT,"I picked up the Sportscaster after seeing some pretty good rebate deals from XM. I got it and all seemed great: Smaller design, remote, easy to see screen, etc. It wore off after about a week. The mounting bracket is terrible. The radio hardly stayed on the bracket. The antenna jack also seemed pretty shotty. The antenna would be plugged in snug, but everytime I hit a bump or the car shook a little more the signal was lost and the 'Check Antenna' screen would come on. It happend way too often. Before I finally got rid of it the buttons on the unit began not working. I guess I pressed the power button on the unit too hard and it got in contact with the channel changing buttons because the channels would change by itself. I now have an XT and couldn't be happier. Better cradle, larger display and just a better product."
2,Great Game - Try playing with 2 unknowns !!!,"It is a great game for kids, and a fun game for teenagers (if you add to it the 2 cards/unknowns it is even more)."
2,A delight to visit Hattie and her friends.,I have read all of Effie Wilders books. I was happy to see a new one out. I loved going back to Fairacres and seeing all my friends. If you haven't read Mrs. Wilders books you are in for a Delight. Charlotte
2,"Kaplan ASVAB, 2007 Edition: The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (Kaplan Asvab)",Great study guide.
2,The boy in the striped pyjamas,An easy read but very moving - the innocence of children comes over in a big way - very enjoyable if sad.
2,Health Journeys Guided Meditation Review,"I love this CD. I have listened to it on a daily basis. Without ever addressing the cause of the trauma, Belleruth Napartsek addresses issues that people with PTSD deal with. Her imagery helps the listener to relax and get in touch with their body. She leads you into the inside of your heart and suggests that someone loving and helpful is with you. There are also affirmations included. I find myself looking forward to listening every night. It is like listening to a kind friend soothing me as I fall asleep. I highly recommend this CD for anyone dealing with PTSD."
1,Batteries go dead when item is not in use,This unit takes 8 C size batteries. New batteries will go dead even with the unit turned off. The first time this happened I assumed that I must have mistakenly left the unit on. When I tried again making certain the unit was off the batteries where dead again when I looked at again a few weeks later. It's fine if you can always plug it in but you must take out the batteries after use if you want to use it where it can't be plugged in. Don't buy this.
1,I've returned,it didn't work properly. Water and steam was coming out from around the valve. I've returned right after running the initial test.
2,Hills & Hudson are the BEST at true crime,"WOW! I didn't think they could top their first book (An Hour to Kill), but they have done so with ""A Reason to Live"". I felt as if I was at the kitchen table with the heroic victim of this story. The crime story is important, but feeling the anguish and the suffering of the victim so intensely is something I have never before experienced....This book should be required reading for all those who pass judgement on perpetrators in the justice system. This family, particularly this woman, are just as heroic as those involved in the Sept 11th attacks. And Hills and Hudson are remarkable in their storytelling. I can hardly wait for their next book!!!!"
2,Pity No International Plan,"I like my kindle very, very much and was hoping that with NY times and WSJ downloads i could do without all the paper and waste.However, i travel overseas every week and am dissapointed that the kindle does not work outside of the US.If you could make arrangements to allow downloading in the Bahamas, i would be very very happy!!!!Daily newspapers in the Bahamas are impossible to get on time, typically a day or two late. this would be magical if you could correct this asap.thank you,CR"
2,"great book, a must read for fantasy lovers","Dragons of Autumn Twilight is the very first book in the Dragonlance series, and if you like fantasy, it is a must read. All the characters have such great, yet differing, personalities. The book also features a lot of action scenes, whether it be hand-to-hand, or the use of magic. Be sure to read the second two books, which are just as good!"
1,Length not as advertised,"This is a very pretty necklace but it is way too long. It is 20 inches, though the ad said 16. I had to pay a jeweler an extra $20 to shorten it 4 inches. I would have preferred to return it, but my husband wanted his mother to keep it. Therefore we ended up paying an extra $20. Would not buy from them again."
1,"no sir, I don't like it","A ""little rough"" on the taste is putting it mildly. I've tried mixing this product a number of ways and every time, the taste makes me gag and I can never finish the whole shake.Which is a shame, since I rather have my vitamins in powder form and the price seemed really good compared to greens+ and other green powder vitamins. I just can't get past the taste on this.If you have tastebuds of steel, go for it but I recommend getting the smaller quantity first to make sure you can handle the taste."
1,Poor quality workmanship,"While the slipper is comfortable enough, the quality of the product is awful. I have had mine for less than 6 months and the soles are seperating from the uppers, the insoles are seperating from the sole, and the sole on the left slipper is splitting at the toe. I have had cheep five dollar slippers last for several YEARS and these last less than 6 months! What a waste of money."
2,I completely Agree,At at&t I work with offshore folks on a regular basis. They are completely incompetant. The communication issues are so problamatic. I learned a great deal from this book. This is a must have for anyone working in IT (especially if you've lost your job to outsourcing).
2,Excellent Educational DVD,"I got this to show a high school American Literature class in another country, and it really captured their attention. It's a very sad but true depiction of the underground railroad and I highly recommend it for any teacher who wants to show and not just tell the story of slavery in America and the people who stood up against it. This gripping story follows 4 runaway slaves on their journey north to freedom and shows the obstacles they met along the way and who survived the journey despite being followed. It's a very well done movie and I've already watched it at least 3 times and still am not tired of seeing it."
2,A Comprehensive Study,"An outstanding book for the watercolor enthusiast. Dewey's chapters cover materials, subject matter and technique that even the advanced watercolorist can learn from. The book is a handy item to help both the practicing artist and teacher. Not so much a step by step study, but rather information that can be applied to the artists individual style and subject matter."
2,Still worth it !,"After reading the other reviews here about this CD , I hesitated to buy it. After buying and listening to it a few times, I am happy I made that choice. Yes, there are a few on here that are not really funny at all, but many really good ones. Sol Rosenberg and Tarbash are still great ! Give it a listen and make your own decision. Remember, the best groups have a few songs on their cd's that are bad !"
1,Very disappointing,"Very disappointing - past units were very good (I have had 3), but this one was nothing but problems and broke after 6 months. I would avoid this model, very disappointing - a waste of money."
1,Owners of 'Burn & Firm' by the same author beware!!,"If you do not own the above mentioned tape, you'll probably find this workout quite good - nice, well choreographed moves, animated and amiable instructor... But if you do, you'll be disappointed to see that what you're buying is just really 'Burn and Firm'. OK, you get an extra yoga routine, but still I feel cheated out of my money."
1,Pure Junk,"This book is pure fiction and pure junk. Much of the book tells you what you allready know, it is difficult to get in. Then it spends a lot of time ellaborating on things you shouldn't do, things noone in their right mind would do anyway. Then it gives you advice that is absolutely absurd. The author is a phoney, and you will agree when you get the book. The reviews listed here are great...."
2,Great indoor fun!,"My boys ages 10, 8, and 6 love to play with the nerf hoops. The comments are hilarious and make the games a lot of fun. The only problem is that the ball is already starting to fall apart. I hope they will make replacement balls available."
1,Armrest not for all vehicles!,"Bought this armrest for my 2009 Dodge Journey. The armrest does not fit the door panel. It seems well built and would have certainly been comfortable, but not on this vehicle."
2,Enjoyable music experience,"John showed his ability to grow and stretch out here, his guitar playing is more impressive on this set than first time round. He also collaborates with musicians from different genre, ?love and Roy Hargrove, to great effect. The songs were not as strong this time, but there was plenty to keep the listener satisfied."
2,Works well,I use these for giving my horse injections. They work fine. There is an excessive outer plastic part that is not necessary for me.
1,Ugh.,"I am not a videogame connoisseur, so if I am completely off, sorry. This was the worst movie I have seen in a while. I really tried to watch and enjoy it, but couldn't even get myself to finish it. I love movies of many genres and styles, but could not get into this at all. I enjoy Michael Cera and the other actors in the film, but this was simply not my cup of tea. I hate to say it, but I want my money back for the rental."
2,Good but only 47 minutes long,"This 1972 tape is only 47 minutes long compared to other concerts tapes being approximately 2 hours. They sing a total of 12 songs. It was more like watching a quick 30 minute T.V. special than a concert. But, it still was The Osmonds and overall I have to say 47 minutes is better than no minutes. I did enjoy the tape and would only recommend it to true die hard Osmond fans."
1,I guess I'm a moron,"The author notes that only a moron will think they can lose weight on the Atkins Diet... I must be a moron then, since I've lost 40lbs with it and have kept it off for 6 months and counting so far."
2,"The 1974 Magickal Childe Edition of ""A True & Faith Relation""","This is the original Magickal Childe edition of Stephen Skinner's reproduction of Meric Casaubon's ""True & Faithful Relation"" from almost 40 years ago; last year a newly re-edited and reconstructed edition was produced and is available asDr. John Dee's Spiritual Diaries: 1583-1608(from Llewellyn) andDr John Dee's Spiritual Diaries (1583-1608) A True & Faithful Relation of What Passed for Many Yeers Between Dr John Dee... & Some Spirits...Revised Edition(from Skinner's own Golden Hoard Press). The new edition is MUCH better, and HIGHLY reccomended for both the Student and the Adept. A quarter-leather limited edition was available at the time of the writing of the review directly from the Golden Hoard Press website, and will be highly collectable."
1,I agree with the Wrath of Khan reviewer!,"I'm no big fan of William Shatner, but at least he can ACT! The sorry lot of actors in this flick may have given this series a final fatal blow. I know no one who is looking forward to the next installment"
1,disappointing,"Nice package it comes in, and it's so big, but I was expecting this book to be so much better, a few good shots, but really missing some of the greatest classic stuff. I guess it's from the manufacture's perspective. They have been an incredible story in the annals of skate history, and everyone who skates knows that Indy's turn like no others, but just becuse they also have a good logo known around the world by skaters and non-skaters alike, did we need to have this basicly boring book to be put out? I don't think it add's much."
2,"nice, deep outlet box","I wanted a deep, heavy duty box because I had a lot of wires. This box was exactly what i wanted."
1,what a yawn,"I was underwhelmed to say the least. I flipped through this book in minutes and was totally disappointed. If you want a book with GREAT recipes and beautifully ""stacked"" plates, get the Top Chef cookbook or the Top Chef quick fire cookbook, they blow this one away!"
2,Excellent original 1862 version,"Sure the 1869 revision is better, but it is good to have variety, and this production of the original 1862 version could not be more appropriate. This was performed in the same opera house as the original 1862 production, and the same beautiful scenery was recreated. The singing is wonderful. I especially liked Gegam Grigorian's high tenor voice. Galina Gorchakova is also excellent. In fact, all the singing is excellent. I recommended this production to go along with your 1869 production."
1,Father of four children,Cutting Loose is a collection of opinions from the exceedingly small minority of women who have found divorce uplifting. The realty is divorce for the large majority of women is a negative life altering experience. Readers should be cautioned that having a positive divorce experience is similar in odds to becoming an olympic athlete.
1,Won't hold air,"My son enjoys this, but it won't hold air for long. The plug does not fit well and allows the ball to deflate quickly. Pretty serious design flaw in my opinion."
1,Not all that,"I read this book expecting a lot more from Margaret Atwood; all I hear about her is high praise.This book read like a boring diary. I think she intended it to be a allegory on loss of civil rights, esp for women but it's just boring."
2,Great!,"I purchased this for my wife based on the advice of the Nurses at our Hospital (every single nurse recommended this item!), and we both having nothing but great things to say about this product. It's easy to use, very easy to sanitize and keep clean, and has multiple settings for personal comfort. Also, the double-pump makes life on the goes SO much easier (15 minutes total vs. 30-40 minutes with a single)! I would highly recommend getting the storage bottles as well...you'll need them!"
1,Paranoid fascist fantasy,"Paranoid fascist fantasy to justify unspeakable crimes by conjuring circumstances that never exist. Thousands of people are tortured, raped and murdered, and none of them have a ticking nuclear time bomb, and most of them are innocent, and are forced to falsely confess and to falsely implicate other innocent people who are then tortured. But sadistic monsters always come back to this same non-existent scenario to justify their crimes and avoid just prosecution. It should be called ""Unwatchable"". This NAZI garbage is incitement to commit crimes against humanity."
2,"Hit, After Hit, After Hit","My word, this band is amazing. This is the histories most underrated band. This album is just so amazing. I buy music from bands that are supposed to be great and I am often left unsatisfied, but not this album. This is perhaps the greatest few dollars I have ever spent. I have complete faith in this band, and I believe that it is in your best interest to buy this album."
1,overpriced,while the item was in good shape the seller was way overpriced. Item showed new price of $7.95 and charged me $20.00 for it. Seller was taking advantage of an out of stock item.I've always had a problem with these kinds of selling tactics.
2,What Jerry has always said--this time in print,"Anyone who has followed Jerry's post-Dean Martin career knows that he has ALWAYS waxed sentimental about their tenure as the world's most popular comics.He has always credited Martin for his (Lewis')show-biz breakthrough,always played up Dean's lack of recognition as ""the greatest straight-man that ever lived"" and has always blamed himself for provoking the split.I agree that Dean would probably never have chimed in with the same level of sentimentality,imagining a mid-90's talk show appearance together,but Jerry has always been the tear-jerker with his loving tales of the Dino years--and it continues to shine through in this brief but touching example of Jerry's humble, humanitarian side."
2,Highly Rated Book,"I bought this as a resource to swell the ranks of my genealogy library. I have not had a chance, as yet, to read it, but I know it will be well worn by the time I am finished."
1,Yikes!,I could barely skim the first ten pages there was so much DRAMA and so many EXCALAMATION POINTS! When I read that JCO used Summers book on Monroe I knew that her product could not be quality.
2,A must have resource,"As an art teacher who has taught at all level from elementary to high school, this is a very valuable resource. I have been a subscriber for 7 years and still have every issue. Whenever I am looking for new ideas for my classes, I turn back to my past issues and always find a great project. One of the best for our field."
2,"three words ""EMOTIONAL TEAR SNATCHER""",never in history has a movie had the ability to control your emotions as this one. EXCELLENT ENTERTAINMENT for the entire family. FIVE STARS
1,Not too happy,Not too happy with this one. Half of the DVDs wouldn't play the episodes!! So I missed out on soo much! I had to fill in the blanks by watching the next episode (if that one would even play)
2,best flea spray made,You can spray your animals and forget about it for 3 months. It lasts through baths. I live in the deep woods and have 5 dogs. This product works!
1,THE ITEM I BOUGHT FROM LEXINGTON HANDBAGS,"I HAT THIS PRODUCT I BOUGHT FROM LEXINGTON HANDBAGS BECAUSE THE ITEM TORE ONLY LESS THEN A MONTH AFTER AND THE DAMN THING TORE. I CAN'T SEE WHY THIS HAPPEN TO ME AND I SENT INFORMATION TO ME I'LL NEVER NO BUT I WILL NOT, I MEAN I WILL NOT BUY FROM THEM AGAIN,.."
1,HP14 Yellow Printhead,"The printhead was to be new, but my printer doesn't think so. The box arrived somewhat smashed which may have cracked the plastic and dried out the printhead. I take some responsibility for not notifying the shipper sooner to give them the opportunity to rectify the problem."
1,Product ok,"The product itself was ok, but I'm not impressed with the company it came from. I purchased two at the same time. They both came from etronics in plastic bags with instructions to a different model of monster icarplay directions. . . no manufacturers box. One of the two didn't work. In order to exchange they insisted in the directions that it must be returned in the manufacturers box. and that you pay the shipping for the return. Although I got a good price for each, because one was broke and I was unable to return I ended up paying what I could have paid at the store."
2,Dependable & stylish,"I bought my Tag eight years ago and have worn it for scuba diving, skiing, exercising, and eating at top French restaurants. Every two or three years I change the battery; otherwise it needs no attention and has performed flawlessly. The only annoying things with the watch are (i) the bezel is difficult to grip with wet fingers or dive gloves, and (ii) there is insufficient contrast between the dial face and the hands when you're underwater, which makes it difficult sometimes to read the time. These two limitations are a function of the fact it was designed more to be fashionable than functional - but it does function pretty well regardless.Many people (men and women) have commented over the years on how attractive the watch is. I wanted a watch that would be able to go wherever I went and be appropriate regardless of conditions. I also wanted something that wasn't too fussy. The Tag has served me well and I don't envisage replacing it anytime soon."
1,Misa Criolla/Misa Luba/Misa Flamenca,I had a version on a 33 record album from the 60's which broke. It was by sung by a Congolese Tribe beating their drums and was fantastic. That is what I was really looking for.
2,LOVE LOVE This Series,My daughter and I watched ALL of this series and just loved it - wish it could have gone on and on but ALL good things must come to an end and we can WATCH it OVER Again Whenever we Want
1,A waste of time,"Mostly pontification. Where's the scholarship? The only reason I sat through this one was that it was an audio book and I was on an eight hour drive. If this is the greatest generation, I'm in the generation that got the bill. This book glossed over most everything. If anything it proved the opposite of its title."
1,Amazing for about 3 months,"When I first received them they sounded amazing, loved every bit of them from their looks to the sound. I used it fairly actively ran a lot with it walked everywhere with them on etc.Now first thing to go was the metal sleeve on the 3.5 connector, it was sliding off and whatever no big deal this happened about a month in. Then the next thing to go was my left ear buds insulating wire, exposing it slowly, still worked fine but it was slowly dieing, then near the connector the insulation broke there too exposing the wire. Then the right earbud's wire was exposed then the left one stopped working altogether. That's when I got new earbudsOverall, i wouldn't buy these again, almost got tempted since i noticed it had a different design on the connector so i thought maybe they got better, but this time i'm gonna heed other peoples reviews and still not get them."
1,Big Disappointment,"This peppermill did not work at all. Not once.To load the batteries and the peppercorns, you have to detach the top half of the mill from the bottom half. No problem. But when you try to reconnect them, BIG problem. The two halves are supposed to click in place with a half turn, but the catch doesn't work. A couple of times, I THOUGHT the catch was engaged, but upon picking the mill up, the two halves disconnected and went tumbling to the countertop -- spraying batteries and peppercorns everywhere. This gets old FAST. I really didn't want to return the product, so I tried repeatedly to get it to work. Finally, however, I had no choice -- the thing simply didn't work. My guess is, the product is just cheaply made. A simple half-turn catch like that should work. But it won't if the plastic is cheap and the workmanship sleazy."
2,This is a 5 star item!,"When I was registering for gifts, I did not think I would need to sterilize bottles since I was going to breastfeed. I planned on using disposable bags for the occassional bottle. What I didn't think about though, was the fact I needed to sterilize my Isis breast pump. Though it can be sterilized in the dishwasher, I found that with the new baby I either had a dishwasher full of dirty dishes to do or clean ones to put away. The Avent sterilizer is extremely quick and easy to use. This is definitely a 5 star item!"
2,Perfect for what it is,"I wanted a cheap, functional PS/PS2 USB adapter that would work hassle-free on Windows 7 x64 and this was it. I don't know about the touch-sensitive button functionality being lost as I don't actually play any games that use that, but everything else works fine. I will say that I have only tested 1 player at a time, so I don't know how well 2-player connections work."
1,Nothing like the HBO series,"I 've always found the TV series wonderful, smart and entertaining.Well, this book isn't. It does give you a glimpse to the same kind of society, and then there's endless babbling about everything one can imagine, accompanied by some sexual innuedo and a depressing atmosphere of vanity and temporarity.Really, the characters from the series either are not present, or they 're totally different, and there is nothing compelling to read about in it, anyway.So, just don't bother."
1,mine must be defective,"I bought this because of rave reviews and a good concept. I wish I could send it back to Bodum and ask them what were they thinking. I am so disappointed. Poor thermal quality, makes a leaky mess unless poored slowly and at just the right angle.. It needs a gasket to prevent leaks and seal in the heat. I just get a better cup out the old time glass carafe."
2,maggots bats brains,"city dwellars move to a big house in the country apon arrival strange events occur. after investigating it is discovered the previous tennant was a deranged doctor , he may be still living . - well made shocker for the italian horror genre"
1,YAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWNNNNNNNNNN,"What a disappointment. Yes, Ed Vedder's patented warble is strong as ever but hints at how good the glory days of the mid-90's were for this seminal band. Now it seems all the good tunes are being done by bands aping the PJ style while the originals are content to bore everyone else to tears with uninspired garbage like RIOT ACT. I couldn't wait for it to end. And to think, this from a band whose singer last great work was with the late, great Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan (Dead Man Walking strk). The record label must be counting the albums left on their contract so as to be rid of them. Pearl Jam is to rock what Prince was to funk/soul - dismal failures as the years went on."
1,Pros and Cons,"Pros: Dishwasher Safe-therefore easy to disinfect, Made of Earth Friendly Materials, Knife friendly, Variety of sizes of availableCons: costly, short life, shows knife marks immediately, warping and bowing after 1 year which means must disinfect after even minor use, hard to clean without dishwasher, absorbs juices from various foods such as beets, absorbs bleach smell which I use to disinfect - 1 part bleach 9 parts water in a spray bottleI bought 2 of these and 1 8 X 6 18 months ago. They were expensive in my opinion, but I felt would last years. I paid about $100 for the 3 and will have to replace all 3 now. I liked the environment friendly materials, but now I have to throw these out because the surface is uneven marking them dangerous for cutting."
1,Why was the movie dubbed?,This movie was a real let down. The characters were not even talking themselves. It looked tacky and unprofessional. I have to admit the gore was pretty foul. Made me feel a bid queasy. But apart from that it was ruined by the fact that it was dubbed. Good story though!
1,"Please, couldn't this be 'No Screeching Attached'?","I used to like NSync way back when their Disney Concert came out. I stopped liking them around last March when I heard ""I Drive Myself Crazy."" I since then have grown to despise the group. I was hoping that with the release of this cd, they would improve. After hearing the intire cd played on my local radio station, I came to the realization that they will never improve. After hearing ""Space Cowboy"" I was on the floor with laughter. It is dissapointing that with such young fans they have, they would write a song like ""Digital Getdown."" So unless you are a hardcore fan who will not admit to the fact they don't have talent or appreciate screeching cats, don't buy the cd."
2,Excellent anime with (surprisingly) NO TECHNO!,"Slayers: The Motion Picture follows the powerful sorceress Lina Inverse and her obnoxious cohort Nahga the Serpent to Mipross Island, where they fight for a love lost long ago, and set right what went so wrong when a Demon attacked the Island's celebrating citezens. If you like magic and mayhem, this is an excellent choice. If you like all anime: get it. It's a refreshing change of pace from the techno and mechs you see so often in today's anime."
1,disappointed,"My granddaughter was thrilled to have this journal. However, it was frustrating because the device doesn't consistently recognize pass words.Also disappointed in the space provided in which to write."
1,Save Your Money & Don't Buy,"The photo of the product online is quite deceptive! The Cozy Kingdom photo makes it look stable, well-constructed and large enough for a normal size cat. In reality, the Cozy Kingdom is anything but. It is basically cardboard and cheap thin plastic. And some of the plastic grooves that needed to be snapped into place arrived broken. No instructions were included, and assembling this piece of garbage took me about 2 hours. I had 2 friends also try to assemble the ""Kingdom,"" but the pieces wouldnt fit together as they were supposed to! The Kingdom would NOT securely snap all together.We got it ""somewhat"" put together and realized that even if we could've gotten it properly assembled, it would have only held a kitten under 3 lbs. Spend a few more bucks, go to regular pet store and buy your cat a real cat condo already assembled and not out of pieces of cardboard and cheap plastic!"
2,A Polished Album,"I can't beleive some of the reviews here (1 star?). I acknowledge that Russian Roulette is not Accept's best album, but what is all this talk of selling out to the commercial market? If anything this album is less commercial than Metal Heart of which I am also a big fan. Russian Roulette's (originally titled Wargames - changed for obvious reasons) content is chiefly about the negatives of war and raises some very serious issuses. Accept showed they had matured with this album in both their personal views and songwriting. As ever the dual guitars, together with the bass and drums of the 4 classicaly trained muscians sounds fantastic, but with a polished edge - not commercial."
1,Waste of Space,"I had high expectations for the book, a definitive account of the 1997 Phoenix Lights UFO case. The introduction, foreword, preface, and acknowledgements were a waste but then I got to Chapter 1 (two pages), which gives a brief overview of the sightings. From then on the book is a waste of paper and I am extremely disappointed I bought it. The author rambles on and on without going anywhere or arriving at a destination. She repeats information over and over and over. Her writing style is unprofessional and, quite frankly, plain boring. The last third of the book is a complete waste, just filler. This is a classic example of someone taking a good 2,000-3,000 word story and trying to stretch it into a book. It just doesn't work. Save your money and go to the library and read news accounts of the lights for free. Or you can find better information online, such as the Jeff Rense site."
2,Beautiful and Poigniant,"Michael Schade has perhaps the most beautiful tenor voice before the public today. He is a superb musician. Everything on this disc is a testament to his place among the greatest lyric tenors; e.g, Wunderlich, Bjorling, Crooks, Schipa..."
1,The worst textbook in computer science. Don't buy it!!,"I had to buy this book because I was taking an algorithm class (2 years ago) and the instructor was the co-author of the book. I didn't learn much from this book. As far as I can remember, part of contents are copied from another yet poorly written book by Horowitz (can't recall the name). Almost everybody in my class had to buy another algorithm book (Cormen) to pass the class.This book was useless to me and many other students in my class.Don't buy it!!"
2,A movie that will make you think and challenge you,"I watch a lot of horror films and in watching what you expect to be your average run of the mill horror film, Backroads was not only surprising but impressive. I love a movie that makes you think and can challenge you. A movie that will make you think about it days and even weeks after you see it. I was shocked and impressed with the director's, Wayne Slaten, hidden and subtle symbolism. The acting, the casting, and the screenplay all come together very nicely to make this a very fun and entertaining pschological horror film. Well done."
2,Solid Spy Novel!,"This book turned out to be nice surprise. Being a Robert Littell fan, the author has done a nice job of capturing the ""spy"" atmosphere that many cannot. This book is about several newly installed MI:5 field operatives who have attempts made on their lives. They flock together after the attempts and try to test the validity of the rumor of Contact Zero, a place of refuge for disassociated spies. As they follow the clandestine clues to potentially reach Contact Zero, their trust in the rumor and in each other begins to wane. Interesting book that for the most parts keeps a pretty quick tempo, not always an task for a spy novel."
1,Wish I had read a few,"Well i wish I had read a few of these reviews before I bought mine.I have windows 98 and I have tried everything i Know to get it to work,nothing helps.So its of to file 13 just money lost.."
2,"He loves it, but...","My 3-months puppy loves these balls! But they dont last long cuz the surface is very easy to bit off. The valve will then comes out. With a few weeks, these balls are over...Next time I will exchange to plastic ones."
1,PC installer only! No Vista! No Mac!,They failed to mention that the installation will only work off a PC. Good luck my fellow Mac owners.... Oh not to mention that you must be running a PC older then Vista to install! I just wanted a straight up adaptor that would search for networks and let me configure.... Not possible!If you own a Mac don't buy!If you own a PC running Vista don't buy!
1,Terrible,"This game is without a doubt, the biggest disappointment that I have had this year. It is absolute crap. The graphics are bad. The control is bad. Whoever said that this is better than Syphon Filter needs to have their head examined. This game is nowhere near as good as Syphon Filter. If you want to play a really good action/stealth/espionage adventure, than I suggest picking up ""Medal of Honor,"" which is a fantastic game set in WWII. If you want to play as James Bond, get an N64 and play Goldeneye (and I hate N64 by the way.) but whatever you do, don't waste any time on this worthless title."
1,Not my *cup of tea*,"I typically enjoy complicated, thought provoking films. 45 minutes into the movie I was totally clueless. I stopped the DVD 1/2 way through the film and went to the ""special features"" to watch the documentary & background about the directors. That helped, a little. I still don't get a lot of the symbolism & I was anticipating a dramatic flood scene at the end that never came.I appreciate the beautiful cinematography and I think I appreciate the director's intentions. The wonderful performances of James Woods, Nick Nolte, Daryl Hannah, Anthony Edwards deserve acknowledgement. Sadly, NORTHFORK left me with an empty, unresolved feeling. A feeling that NORTHFORK could have been better."
2,Love and Emotion,Hello: I feel only love and passion when i hear this man sing. Brings out the best in me.
2,Stant pressure tester,"Good price on unit and it arrived in reasonable time. Works well, but I did have to buy a separate adapter for one vehicle (Nissan)."
1,Worst Movie of the Century - An Embarassment...,"DO NOT waste your time, or money. Long, withered and withering. Boring with absolutely no point. Speilberg should hang his head... I wish I'd wasted my money somewhere else..."
1,A bore of twilight...,"I was disappointed in this book. It had the usual wonderful character descriptions and smooth flow, but lacked the substance of her prior works.Previous books by Ms. Hamilton just grabbed you by the collar and dragged you through the story steadily building to what you knew was going to be an awesome...ending and ultimately leave you craving for more. It seemed that this book just ""lolligaged"" its way through a story and then it seemed that she realized that she was almost out of paper and just threw in the quick ""last 5 minutes of Star-Trek"" ending that kind of neatly wraps it up, but leaves you disappointed and craving for ""something"".It seemed to me that Ms. Hamilton just ""phoned"" this one in. I am disappointed, but still a fan, and I anxiously await further works, but in a different way. I find myself hoping new works will make up for this one, rather than just assuming it will be great like all of her great stories I had grown accustomed to."
1,An atempt to make a book without writing one.,"I was not very satisfied with my purchase of this so-called ""book."" It seems as though the author wanted to write a book but did not want to dedicate the time. On the positive side, the author did find a good way to keep his old homework assignments from gathering dust."
2,Patience is a virtue,"This book covers far more than the basics, it's actually more of a ""project management"" plan for starting a new business, laid out pretty much over the course of a year.If you're looking to write up a ""business plan in a day"" you won't find it here.However, if you're looking for covering nearly every nuance of a small business plan, and do your homework (this is a workbook as much as a readable book) - this is for you.A great feature - it's a workbook, not on a PC.That's not to say you can't use a PC to do your ""homework"", but it's definitely a bonus if your computer crashes, or for the Mac user who doesn't have (or want) access to biz plan warez - most of which don't ""teach"" anyhow.If your business idea is a true small business, this is a great resource. If you're looking to start a SOHO, solo gig - it's probably overkill, but still useful."
1,Disappointment,"I bought this camera to take to the Keys on a snorkeling trip. I made sure to load the film when I arrived in FL, I was careful with the rubber ring so as to insure a tight seel and still the camera leaked. I was never attempting a picture at a depth further than a few feet. What a crappy camera. I wasted two rolls of film and four batteries before I just gave up...save your money, I wish I had!"
2,Clip dents crib railing,"My baby loves playing with this toy after 4 months - there are so many parts of it that hold her attention. Prior to that, she didn't seem interested, so I tried to attach it to her crib to look at. The ""clip"" is really a single piece of hard plastic with a 1/8 inch gap to one side. In order to attach it, I had to twist the plastic and slide it onto the crib railing. It hurt my hand and scratched little dents onto the wooden railing because the plastic is thick and the clip hard to open up. The only place it can be hooked up to is the play mat or activity center with the arches.One other annoying thing is that the instructions say ""surface wash only."" Considering that this toy is probably meant to be chewed and slobbered on, I was disappointed that you're not supposed to wash the insides (which might be soaked with slobber)."
1,Disjoint Rambling,"This seemed to have the potential to be an interesting performance piece, but it just didn't come together. It was a disjoint and rambling hour with no overarching point or theme to pull it together."
2,Dan Diveley,"This is the best b2b branding book that I have read. Unlike other branding experts, the author presents branding in a simple, straightforward way. None of the typical b.s. other writers throw in to try to make them look smarter (and sell more books). Anyone in b2b marketing should read this book. As trite as this is going to sound, I think we all need to learn about branding in order to make our clients' companies strong which in turn, builds the economy and keeps our country prosperous."
2,A MUST HAVE FOR ANY WICCAN,"THIS BOOK IS EXTREMELY USEFUL FOR ANYONE WHO IS PRACTICING CELTIC MAGIC, HAS AN INTEREST IN MAGIC, OR IS SIMPLY LOOKING TO EXPAND THEIR KNOWLEDGE FOR CROSS REFERENCE. THE SECTION ON HERBS IS VERY HANDY WHEN DESIGNING RITUALS AND SPELLS FOR ALL PURPOSES. THE RITUALS INCLUDED IN THE BOOK ARE STRAIGHT FORWARD AND EXPLAINED IN A VERY CLEAR AND CONCISE MANNER AND MAKE MAGIC EASY TO UNDERSTAND FOR EVERYONE FROM THE NOVICE TO THE ADEPT"
1,Print head gone after 16 months,My mfc printer was not working ok since about a couple of months. Today when I call up Brother help line they say that the print head is gone and may have to replace it ($150) value! . I have not taken more than 300 prints in these 16 months . Not worth buying this machine.
2,Big bang for the bucks!,"This is a great receviver,I have hade mine for about 3 months and it will do everything.I have a sony DVD recorder running through it and it makes the whole room move. It's not the best but vary few would be able to tell it."
1,What the f**k!,"This could have been an awsome book! But, instead, all that was published were unfinished ideas and bad writing. Characters seem to change age or names within a few pages (without time passing, motivations aren't clear, I could go on. I agree that some editing would have helped, but the writing gave the impression that the author didn't really care. Just handed over notes or something. I threw the book away after reading it. If the author and publisher don't care, why should we?"
1,Tainted history,"I read this book due to my interest in early American history. About half way through I started reading reports of how the author totally concocted his findings - using records that don't exist and blatantly misreporting others.So this book has lost absolutely all credibility with me. Trying to accept anything in this book as fact would be like trusting an encyclopedia that reported that WWII was fought in the 50s.Bellesiles allowed politics to get in the way of true history. If he didn't like the results of what he found, he should have shelved the project."
1,Worst Purchase!,I had to return this book. It is outdated compared to the other bible dictionaries out there. I wouldn't waste my time purchasing this book. It doesn't contain much information. I wouldn't want this dictionary if it was given to me free. A regular dictionary may be better than this one.
1,EDITED?!?!?!?!,"Why are Werner/Carsey so greedy??? The editing is inexcusable! And whoever hates this show, as Roseanne said in one episode, ""May they ROT IN HELL!"" I'm very glad that seasons 2-9 will not be edited. See, this isn't Roseanne's fault. It's Anchor Bay's/Tom Werner's/Marcy Carsey's fault. I will, however, still buy this but only because I feel like I absolutely HAVE to have it."
2,Best nursing pillow,I got both this pillow and the boppie pillow. The Brest Friend is MUCH easier to use. Baby doesn't slip off of it as easily and it provides more back support.
2,Great moist heat,"This is a great reusable moist heat. A tad pricey, but I've been using it 3 times a day for nearly a year and it's still in really good shape."
1,Pre-recorded garbage!,"It's clear that Sarah Brightman is lipsyncing this performance. Throughout the years, when Sarah does sing live (it's rarer than you would think!) she has a very noticeable breathing pattern, hand movements and facial expressions...all of which suddenly disappear in this performance!Also, if you watch her recent truly live performances her vocals are dismal and not the level of richness presented in this performance. It just is tacky and disgusting she parades about giving these performances and lying to people...this is not her ""live"" voice but pre-recorded."
